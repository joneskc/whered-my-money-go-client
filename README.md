# Where'd my Money Go?

An app for consolidating all your bills in one place, organizing them by due dates and allow you to check them off when they're paid.

### Limited Use

App is only a prototype with 3 demo usernames:

## Future Implementations

- Build fully authenticated login with the ability to create and edit users.
- Have 'paid' functionality automatically bump due-date to next month's due date
